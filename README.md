SmallDatasetBenchmarks
======================
This repo is for testing models on small (classification) datasets.

It uses a subset of this dataset: UCI++, a huge collection of preprocessed datasets for supervised classification problems in ARFF format

Note that UCI++ reuses the same data in different configurations.
